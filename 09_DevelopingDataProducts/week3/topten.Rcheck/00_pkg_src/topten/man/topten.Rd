\title{building a model with top ten features
develops aprediction algorithm based on the top 10 features
in 'x' that are most predictive of 'y'}
\usage{
topten(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a n 8p matrix of n observation and p prediction}

\item{y}{a vector of length n representing the response}
}
\value{
a vectorof coefficient from the final model with top 10 features

\description{
building a model with top ten features
develops aprediction algorithm based on the top 10 features
in 'x' that are most predictive of 'y'
}
\details{
this function runs a univariate regression of each predictor
in x and calculates a p-value indicating the significance of
the assosiation. The final set of 10 predictors is taken from
the 10 smallest p-values.
